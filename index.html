            <p class="lead">Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.</p>

            <p class="fine-print">Beautiful may not be the word some people would use for this angular, aggressive creature, but there is no denying it can be visually spectacular when seen in the right light. Colourful, unusual and strangely beautiful.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="column one-fourth">
            <img class="flex" src="http://www.top10listland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/grasshopper.jpg" />
            <p class="fine-print">Grasshoppers are most often green or brown and quite plain to look at in this guise. But there are many species that use the full colour palate to decorate themselves. The best of these insects are strikingly beautiful and if you happen to catch a group of them you will be in for a visual feast.</p>

          <div class="column one-fourth">
            <img class="flex" src="http://www.top10listland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/dragonfly-300x215.jpg" />
            <p class="fine-print">These little beauties can be difficult to see properly as they flit around the garden at speed. You can generally see iridescent blues and greens on their wispy wings and long, thin body. If you do get a chance to see them at rest their full glory will be revealed. A good size, balanced profile and bright colouring make them a real treat.</p>

          <div class="column one-fourth">
            <img class="flex" src="http://www.top10listland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ulysses3-300x199.jpg" />
            <p class="fine-print">There are arguably more spectacular insects when you have the benefit of a magnifying glass, but the Ulysses Butterfly shares its beauty with the unaided eye and itâ€™s a pleasure to watch it dance across your field of vision. The spectacular, iridescent blue contrasts wonderfully with the inky black wings and body. Tear drop hind wings complete the classic butterfly profile.</p>
